Proof of Concept JPEG decoder using Allwinners CedarX
=====================================================

*WARNING*: Don't use on "production systems". This was made by reverse
engineering and might crash your system or destroy data!
It was made only for my personal use of testing the reverse engineered
things, so don't expect good code quality. It's far from complete and
might crash if the JPEG doesn't fit it's requirements!

Usage:
------

make
./jpeg-test example.jpg

If everything works, output is .ppm (Portable Pixmap).
You might pipe it into ImageMagick:

./jpeg-test example.jpg | display -
